# discord-bots
These are my discord bots :)

============================================================================

mcserver-active-checker:
  
  This bot is hosted on the same server as the one that hosts my minecraft server for my friends.
  I set it up so that whenever the list of users online changes on my minecraft server changes, 
  the bot will send a message to an activity channel on my discord server. I made it so my friends could no who's 
  online and when.
