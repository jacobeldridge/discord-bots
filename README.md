# discord-bots
These are my discord bots :)

============================================================================

mcserver-active-checker:
  
  This bot is hosted on the same server as the one that hosts my Minecraft server for my friends.
  I set it up so that whenever the list of users online changes on my Minecraft server changes, 
  the bot will send a message to an activity channel on my Discord server. I made it so my friends could know who's 
  online and when.
